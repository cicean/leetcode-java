 Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

 Example:

 Input:
 [1,2,3]

 Output:
 3

 Explanation:
 Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

 [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
