/**
 * You have a map that marks the location of a treasure island. Some of the map area has jagged rocks and dangerous reefs.
 * Other areas are safe to sail in. There are other explorers trying to find the treasure.
 * So you must figure out a shortest route to the treasure island.
 *
 * Assume the map area is a two dimensional grid, represented by a matrix of characters.
 * You must start from the top-left corner of the map and can move one block up, down, left or right at a time.
 * The treasure island is marked as X in a block of the matrix. X will not be at the top-left corner.
 * Any block with dangerous rocks or reefs will be marked as D.
 * You must not enter dangerous blocks. You cannot leave the map area.
 * Other areas O are safe to sail in. The top-left corner is always safe.
 * Output the minimum number of steps to get to the treasure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * [['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
 *  ['D', 'O', 'D', 'O'],
 *  ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
 *  ['X', 'D', 'D', 'O']]
 *
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Route is (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0) The minimum route takes 5 steps.
