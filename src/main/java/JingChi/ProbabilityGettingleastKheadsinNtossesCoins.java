     * Probability of getting at least K heads in N tosses of Coins
     * Given N number of coins, the task is to find probability of getting at least K number of heads after tossing all the N coins simultaneously.
     *
     * Example :
     *
     * Suppose we have 3 unbiased coins and we have to
     * find the probability of getting at least 2 heads,
     * so there are 23 = 8 ways to toss these
     * coins, i.e.,
     * HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT
     *
     * Out of which there are 4 set which contain at
     * least 2 Heads i.e.,
     * HHH, HHT, HH, THH
     *
     * So the probability is 4/8 or 0.5

    //A Naive approach is to store the value of factorial in dp[] array and call it directly whenever it is required.
    // But the problem of this approach is that we can only able to store it up to certain value,
    // after that it will lead to overflow.
    //
    //Below is the implementation of above approach

        // Preprocess all factorial only upto 19,
        // as after that it will overflow

    /**
     * Method 2 (Dynamic Programming and Log)
     * Another way is to use Dynamic programming and logarithm. log() is indeed useful to store the factorial
     * of any number without worrying about overflow. Letâ€™s see how we use it:
     *
     * At first let see how n! can be written.
     * n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
     *
     * Now take log on base 2 both the sides as:
     * => log(n!) = log(n) + log(n-1) + log(n-2) + ... + log(3)
     *          + log(2) + log(1)
     *
     * Now whenever we need to find the factorial of any number, we can use
     * this precomputed value. For example:
     * Suppose if we want to find the value of nCi which can be written as:
     * => nCi = n! / (i! * (n-i)! )
     *
     * Taking log2() both sides as:
     * => log2 (nCi) = log2 ( n! / (i! * (n-i)! ) )
     * => log2 (nCi) = log2 ( n! ) - log2(i!) - log2( (n-i)! )  `
     *
     * Putting dp[num] = log2 (num!), we get:
     * => log2 (nCi) = dp[n] - dp[i] - dp[n-i]
     *
     * But as we see in above relation there is an extra factor of 2n which
     * tells the probability of getting i heads, so
     * => log2 (2n) = n.
     *
     * We will subtract this n from above result to get the final answer:
     * => Pi (log2 (nCi)) = dp[n] - dp[i] - dp[n-i] - n
     *
     * Now: Pi (nCi) = 2 dp[n] - dp[i] - dp[n-i] - n
     *
     * Tada! Now the questions boils down the summation of Pi for all i in
     * [k, n] will yield the answer which can be calculated easily without
     * overflow.
