 * On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.
 *
 * Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.
 *
 * Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.
 *
 * Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.)
 *
 * Eventually, we reach all R * C spaces of the grid.
 *
 * Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
 * Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
 * Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]

     * Solution
     * Approach 1: Walk in a Spiral
     * Intuition
     *
     * We can walk in a spiral shape from the starting square, ignoring whether we stay in the grid or not. Eventually, we must have reached every square in the grid.
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Examining the lengths of our walk in each direction, we find the following pattern: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ... That is, we walk 1 unit east, then 1 unit south, then 2 units west, then 2 units north, then 3 units east, etc. Because our walk is self-similar, this pattern repeats in the way we expect.
     *
     * After, the algorithm is straightforward: perform the walk and record positions of the grid in the order we visit them. Please read the inline comments for more details.
     * Complexity Analysis
     *
     * Time Complexity: O((\max(R, C))^2)O((max(R,C))
     * 2
     *  ). Potentially, our walk needs to spiral until we move RR in one direction, and CC in another direction, so as to reach every cell of the grid.
     *
     * Space Complexity: O(R * C)O(Râˆ—C), the space used by the answer.
