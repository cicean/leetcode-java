 * Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.
 *
 * Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcabc"
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again).
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "aaacb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
 * s only consists of a, b or c characters.

 * For each position we simply need to find the first occurrence of a/b/c on or after this position.
 * So we can pre-compute three link-list of indices of each a, b, and c.
