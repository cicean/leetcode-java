 * Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
 *
 * Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
 *
 * The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
 *
 * The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
 *
 * Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
 *
 * Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win or "Tie" if they end the game with the same score.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
 * Output: "Bob"
 * Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
 * Output: "Alice"
 * Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
 * If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
 * If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
 * Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,6]
 * Output: "Tie"
 * Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,-1,-2,-3,7]
 * Output: "Alice"
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: values = [-1,-2,-3]
 * Output: "Tie"

 * The game can be mapped to minmax game. Alice tries to maximize the total score and Bob tries to minimize it.
 * Use dynamic programming to simulate the game. If the total score was 0 the game is "Tie",
 * and if it has positive value then "Alice" wins, otherwise "Bob" wins.
