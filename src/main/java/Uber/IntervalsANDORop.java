/**
 * Given 2 sets of intervals.

 Interval is defined with left and right border and discrete points, like [2, 3], [0, 0], etc.

 Set of intervals is non intersected set of sorted intervals, for example: [0, 0], [2, 2], [5, 10] is a valid set of intervals, but :
 * [0, 0], [1, 2] is not valid, because you can write it as [0, 2].
 * [0, 2], [1, 5] is not valid as well, since these two intervals intersect.

 You need to find the AND operation of these two sets. For example:

 1st set: [0, 2], [5, 10], [16, 20] [25, 26] [28, 30]. 鍥磋鎴戜滑@1point 3 acres
 2nd set: [1, 5], [11, 12], [14, 18] [20, 23]

 AND Result: [1, 2], [5, 5], [16, 18], [20, 20]

 OR

 1st set: [0, 2], [6, 8], [16, 20]
 2nd set: [1, 5], [12, 18], [20, 23]

 [0,8], [12,23]
