 * Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
 *
 * One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
 *
 * Your implementation should support following operations:
 *
 * MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
 * Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
 * isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3
 * circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
 * circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
 * circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
 * circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
 * circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * All values will be in the range of [0, 1000].
 * The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 1000].
 * Please do not use the built-in Queue library.

    /**
     * Approach 1: Array
     * Intuition
     *
     * Based on the description of the problem, an intuitive data structure that meets all the requirements
     * would be a ring where the head and the tail are adjacent to each other.
     *
     * However, there does not exist a ring data structure in any programming language. A similar data structure
     * at our disposal is the one called Array which is a collection of elements that reside continuously in one dimensional space.
     *
     * The essence of many design problems, is how one can build more advanced data structures with the basic building blocks such as Array.
     *
     * In this case, to build a circular queue, we could form a virtual ring structure with the Array, via the manipulation of index.
     *
     * Given a fixed size array, any of the elements could be considered as a head in a queue.
     * As long as we know the length of the queue, we then can instantly locate its tail, based on the following formula:
     *
     * \text{tailIndex} = (\text{headIndex} + \text{count} - 1) \mod \text{capacity}tailIndex=(headIndex+countâˆ’1)modcapacity
     *
     * where the variable capacity is the size of the array, the count is the length of the queue and the headIndex
     * and tailIndex are the indice of head and tail elements respectively in the array. Here we showcase a few examples
     * how a circular queue could reside in a fixed size array.
     *
     * pic
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * The procedure to design a data structure lies essentially on how we design the attributes within the data structure.
     *
     * One of the traits of a good design is to have as less attributes as possible, which arguably could bring several benefits.
     *
     * Less attributes usually implies little or no redundancy among the attributes.
     * The less redundant the attributes are, the simpler the manipulation logic, which eventually could be less error-prone.
     * Less attributes also requires less space and therefore it could also bring efficiency to the runtime performance.
     * However, it is not advisable to seek for the minimum set of attributes. Sometimes,
     * a bit of redundancy could help with the time complexity. After all, like many other problems,
     * we are trying to strike a balance between the space and the time.
     *
     * Following the above principles, here we give a list of attributes and the thoughts behind each attribute.
     *
     * queue: a fixed size array to hold the elements for the circular queue.
     * headIndex: an integer which indicates the current head element in the circular queue.
     * count: the current length of the circular queue, i.e. the number of elements in the circular queue. Together with the headIndex,
     * we could locate the current tail element in the circular queue, based on the formula we gave previously. Therefore,
     * we choose not to add another attribute for the index of tail.
     * capacity: the capacity of the circular queue, i.e. the maximum number of elements that can be hold in the queue.
     * One might argument that it is not absolutely necessary to add this attribute,
     * since we could obtain the capacity from the queue attribute. It is true. Yet, since we would frequently
     * use this capacity in our algorithm, we choose to keep it as an attribute, instead of invoking function len(queue)
     * in Python at every occasion. Though in other programming languages such as Java, it might be more efficient
     * to omit this attribute, since it is part of the attributes (queue.length) in Java array. Note: for the sake of consistency,
     * we keep this attribute for all implementations.
     *
     * Complexity
     *
     * Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(1)O(1). All of the methods in our circular data structure is of constant time complexity.
     * Space Complexity: \mathcal{O}(N)O(N). The overall space complexity of the data structure is linear, where NN is the pre-assigned capacity of the queue. However,
     * it is worth mentioning that the memory consumption of the data structure remains as its pre-assigned capacity during its entire life cycle.

     * As a followup question though, an interviewer might ask one to point out a potential defect about the implementation and the solution.
     *
     * This time, it is not about the space or time complexity, but concurrency. Our circular queue is NOT thread-safe.
     * One could end up with corrupting our data structure in a multi-threaded environment.
     *
     * For example, here is an execution sequence where we exceed the designed capacity of the queue and overwrite the tail element undesirably.

     * The above scenario is called race conditions as described in the problem of Print in Order. One can find more concurrency problems to practice on LeetCode.
     *

     * Approach 2: Singly-Linked List
     * Intuition
     *
     * Similar with Array, the Linked List is another common building block for more advanced data structures.
     *
     * Different than a fixed size Array, a linked list could be more memory efficient, since it does not pre-allocate memory for unused capacity.
     *
     * With a singly-linked list, we could design a circular queue with the same time and space complexity as the approach with Array.
     * But we could gain some memory efficiency, since we don't need to pre-allocate the memory upfront.
     *
     * In the following graph, we show how the operations of enQueue() and deQueue() can be done via singly-linked list.
     *
     * pic
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Here we give a list of attributes in our circular queue data structure and the thoughts behind each attribute.
     *
     * capacity: the maximum number of elements that the circular queue will hold.
     * head: the reference to the head element in the queue.
     * count: the current length of the queue. This is a critical attribute that helps us to do the boundary check in each method.
     * tail: the reference to the tail element in the queue. Unlike the Array approach, we need to explicitly keep the reference to the tail element. Without this attribute,
     * it would take us \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) time complexity to locate the tail element from the head element.
     * Complexity
     *
     * Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) for each method in our circular queue.
     * Space Complexity: The upper bound of the memory consumption for our circular queue would be \mathcal{O}(N)O(N), same as the Array approach. However, it should be more memory efficient as we discussed in the intuition section.
