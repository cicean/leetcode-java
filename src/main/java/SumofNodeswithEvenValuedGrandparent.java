 * Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)
 *
 * If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
 * The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.

 * Traverse the tree keeping the parent and the grandparent.
 * If the grandparent of the current node is even-valued, add the value of this node to the answer.
