 * 469. Convex Polygon
 DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
 Discuss Pick One
 Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

 Note:

 There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
 Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
 You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
 Example 1:

 [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]

 Answer: True

 Example 2:

 [[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]

 Answer: False

   Well, I have to say that this problem is beyond my knowledge. @Ipeq1 and @zzg_zzm have explained how to solve this problem in their posts

   https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/70664/c-7-line-o-n-solution-to-check-convexity-with-cross-product-of-adajcent-vectors-detailed-explanation
   The algorithm itself is not hard but I have no idea there exists such a way to determine if a polygon is convex or not. Laugh at me for my ignorance... I believe 90% of programmers can solve this problem if they were given the formula.
   Anyway, following is the Java solution with in-line explanation. Accepted, 32ms. Reference: http://csharphelper.com/blog/2014/07/determine-whether-a-polygon-is-convex-in-c/
