/**
 * 476. Number Complement
 DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
 Discuss Pick One
 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Note:
 The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 Example 1:
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 Example 2:
 Input: 1
 Output: 0
 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

   * Java 1 line bit manipulation solution
   I post solution first and then give out explanation. Please think why does it work before read my explanation.
   * According to the problem, the result is

   The flipped version of the original input but
   Only flip N bits within the range from LEFTMOST bit of 1 to RIGHTMOST.
   For example input = 5 (the binary representation is 101), the LEFTMOST bit of 1 is the third one from RIGHTMOST (100, N = 3). Then we need to flip 3 bits from RIGHTMOST and the answer is 010
   To achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:

   Create a bit mask which has N bits of 1 from RIGHTMOST. In above example, the mask is 111. And we can use the decent Java built-in function Integer.highestOneBit to get the LEFTMOST bit of 1, left shift one, and then minus one. Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with N ones at RIGHTMOST, you will be able to use it later.
   Negate the whole input number.
   Bit AND numbers in step 1 and 2.
   Three line solution if you think one line solution is too confusing:

    public int findComplement(int num) {
      int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;
      num = ~num;
      return num & mask;
    }
